Module 18, Tableau Challenge with City Bikes Data

The CityBikes Tableau Story will show us different aspects on the usage of the bikes distributed all along New York City; all the data use was based on the publicly available data on the website citibikenyc.com, pertaining to the first half of the month in January 2023.

While reviewing the story you will understand what the weekly demand of the bikes through the days of the week is.

### Page 1 
Page 1 of the story will show the locations where the bikes were located thorough the New York Metro Area, this demonstrates how wide the availability is in either Classic or Electric bikes by toggling the filter “Rideable Type”.

### Page 2
Page 2 will be showing a breakdown of the bikes demand over the different days of the week and the hour of the day.

Looking at the demand per day we can clearly notice a trend on the weekdays; the hours of the weekdays (Mon to Fri) are telling us that the demand is very inclined to commute use as the timing shows an increased demand starting from 5am to 11am and from 3pm to 8pm (approximately). 

We can note that the usage of the bikes over the weekends is different, and we could attribute to this that the bikes can be used for leisure or non-work-related needs.

### Page 3 
Page 3 will show the average trip duration for every day of the week on both Electric and Classic bikes broken down into times of day brackets or slots, being:
-	“Very Early Morning” from 3am to 6am, 
-	“Early Morning from 6am to 9am, 
-	“Late Morning” from 9am to 12pm, 
-	“Early Afternoon” from 12pm to 3pm,   
-	“Late Afternoon” from 3pm to 6pm, 
-	“Evening” from 6pm to 9pm,
-	“Late Evening” from 9pm to 12pm, 
-	“Late Night” from 12am to 3am.

This also confirms the observation in Page 2, that the average usage time increased on weekends compared to weekdays, this tells us that the users take more time on their rides on leisure or non-work-related activities versus short time commute that would be shorter to get in time to the users’ workplace.

### Page 4 
Page 4 will show the Time Brackets explained in Page 3 and the breakdown of the “Member Types”, “casual” vs “members”. The demand of the bikes is solidly Mon through Fri from the members, again supporting the theory of the bikes being used for commuting to work.

### Page 5
Lastly Page 5 of the story is showing us a different view of the time brackets per day of the week demand, it highlights the demand or usage per bike type of the time brackets per day. It shows that the most common time demand in any day of the week is “Late Morning” to “Late Afternoon”.
